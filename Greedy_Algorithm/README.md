#Greedy Alorithm

Greedy Algorithms is the problem solving technique where we make the locally optimum choice at each stage & hope to achieve a global optimum

    1)Optimizatioon :->min,max
    2)Sorting
    3)No Fixed rule
    4)not realize

    *Pros
        ->Simple & Easy Good enough TC

    *Cons
        ->A lot of time,global,optimum is not achieved
