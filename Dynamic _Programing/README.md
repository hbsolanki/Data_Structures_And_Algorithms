# Dynamic Programming

-> DP is optimized recursion

- How to identify DP ?
  a. Optimal Proble
  b. Some choice is given (multiple branches in recursion tree)

* DP Definition
  -> Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substrucute property

* Ways of DP

1. Memoization (TOP DOWN)
2. Tabulation (BOTTOM UP)
